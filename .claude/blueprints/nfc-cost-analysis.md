## Key Insights

### Cost per Tap
- **Decreases with scale** due to fixed cost distribution
- Sweet spot around 5,000-10,000 taps/day
- Marginal cost approaches $0.02/tap at scale

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Conversion Rate**: Must maintain >10% trial-to-paid
2. **Churn Rate**: Keep below 5% monthly
3. **CAC Payback**: Recover CAC within 6 months
4. **Gross Margin**: Maintain above 70%

### Risk Factors
1. **Infrastructure costs** scale faster than linear
2. **Support costs** can explode without automation
3. **Payment processing** fees impact margins
4. **SMS costs** can be significant at scale

### Recommendations
1. **Start small**: Validate with 100 users before scaling
2. **Focus on conversion**: Better to have 100 paying users than 1,000 free
3. **Automate early**: Build self-service from day one
4. **Monitor unit economics**: Track CAC and LTV religiously
5. **Plan for scale**: Architecture decisions matter at 10k taps/day

## Appendix: Cost Calculation Formulas

### Infrastructure Scaling Formula
```
Monthly Cost = Base Cost + (Users × $0.10) + (Taps × $0.001) + (Storage GB × $0.23)
```

### Support Cost Formula
```
Support Cost = (Active Users × 0.02 × Tickets/User × $25/Ticket)
```

### SMS Cost Formula
```
SMS Cost = (Taps × SMS_Rate × $0.0075)
Where SMS_Rate varies by tier:
- Free: 0%
- Basic: 5%
- Standard: 10%
- Premium: 20%
```

### Bandwidth Formula
```
Bandwidth (GB) = (Taps × 0.0002) + (Users × 0.01) + (Analytics Views × 0.001)
```
